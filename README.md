# Welcome!

### The following project is part 1 of 2 for Assignment 2 of the UCB Full Stack Coding Bootcamp

```html

<p>I employed HTML and Bootstrap CSS to make a responsive portfolio outlining myself and my professional development. The point of this exercise was to not use my own external CSS and only use what's already on the Bootstrap CDN. I included a pre-designed navigation bar that sticks to the top of the page, preexisting CSS classes to markup the page, and Bootstrap autolayout columns to accomodate screen sizes from all devices. A snippet of code below exemplifies the use of the form-inline class in a navbar:</p>
```

```html

<nav class="navbar sticky-top navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark">
    <div class="container collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarTogglerDemo01">
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Jackson Sabol</a>
    <ul class="form-inline navbar-nav mt-2 mt-lg-0">
        <li class="nav-item active">
        <a class="nav-link" href="index.html">About<span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>
        </li>
        <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="contact.html">Contact</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</nav>
```

### Feel free to play around with the responsive Bootstrap elements by resizing your browser window.
